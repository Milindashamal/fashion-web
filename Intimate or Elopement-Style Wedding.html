                            <ul><li>Intimate weddings, on the other hand, allow for a slightly larger guest list, usually ranging from a handful to a couple of dozen guests. This format retains the essence of a traditional wedding but on a smaller scale.</li></ul>
                        
                           <p><h3>Ceremony Focus:</h3></p>
                              <ul><li>Elopements often focus on the ceremony itself, which can be brief and personal, followed by a creative portrait session to capture the couple's special moments 
                            </li></ul>
                              <ul><li>Intimate weddings resemble traditional weddings in structure, including elements like a ceremony, reception, and possibly a meal, but with a more relaxed atmosphere.
                            </li></ul>
                        
                              <p><h3>Planning and Logistics:</h3></p>

                                 <ul><li>ntimate weddings, while still simpler than large weddings, may involve more planning regarding venue, catering, and decor, allowing couples to create a unique experience for their close friends and family.
                                </li></ul>
