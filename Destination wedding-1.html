                    <h1>Destination wedding</h1>
                    <P><h5> A destination wedding is a wedding ceremony and reception that takes place away from the couple's hometown. This type of wedding can occur in various locations, including exotic beaches, historic cities, or even local venues that are not the couple's primary residence. The key characteristic is that it typically requires travel for both the couple and their guests </h5></P>

                          <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                          <ul><li>Location: While many think of destination weddings as being in far-off places, they can also occur in locations that are simply outside the couple's immediate area. For example, a wedding in a nearby city that requires travel for most guests can still be considered a destination wedding</li></ul>
                          <ul><li>Guest Experience: Couples often curate unique experiences for their guests, making the travel worthwhile. This can include planned activities, excursions, and group gatherings that enhance the overall experience.</li></ul>
                          <ul><li>Cost: Interestingly, destination weddings can sometimes be more affordable than traditional weddings, as they often involve fewer guests and can take advantage of package deals offered by resorts and venues</li></ul>
